          I’ve been working in full-stack development professionally since 2016,
          my main tools being Ruby on Rails and the ecosystem of skills and
          technologies that surround that. I lean more towards the backend in my
          experience, but have done front end and full-stack projects using
          React, vanilla JavaScript, and the old workhouse that was jQuery.
          Similarly, I’m competent in several forms of CSS, including libraries
          such as Bootstrap and Tailwind.

          My developer career began with an internship at a travel startup,
          where I primarily did front end work, but was also exposed to some
          Python and Django. Following that, I had two back-end focused contract
          positions using Ruby and Rails, working on a real estate application
          and a stock exchange app respectively. My first permanent developer
          position was within a small division of a private mid-sized
          recruitment firm, where I worked with the lead developer and
          eventually wore many hats, eventually assuming primary responsibility
          for this firm’s small and medium business self-serve recruitment
          software. After two and a half years there, I moved on with a desire
          to assume more responsibility and learn newer technologies, working in
          more senior full-stack positions on an email and LinkedIn sales
          campaign application, and most recently on software for brokers
          working in commercial real estate transactions.

          I’ve worked in both feature creation and maintenance, and have seen
          setups ranging from the newest and hottest to 10+ year old beasts
          running dead libraries and frameworks, such as
          <a href="https://github.com/hobo/hobo">“Hobo”</a>. I’m a generalist
          who favours making code as consistent and comprehensible as possible.
          I value coherent writing and “idiot proofing”, and put these into
          practice wherever it is feasible.

          Some of the more notable projects that I’ve worked on:
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-1 font-gelasio">
          – A job ad creator for recruiters. Essentially a “lego kit” of
          components of job ads, which used a shared, curated, editable and
          searchable set of “snippets” of parts of job ads, allowing for
          standardized rapid write ups for job postings.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-1 font-gelasio">
          – A major upgrade of a 2011 era Rails 3.2 + Ruby 1.9 medium-sized
          application to Rails 4.2 and Ruby 2.5.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-1 font-gelasio">
          – A custom logging interface for massive interactor objects in a Rails
          and React application. We had no usable production logs before this
          project. Afterwards, we could hone in on crucial production debugging
          information.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-1 font-gelasio">
          – Led a team of three developers to work on both the front and back
          ends of a Rails/React feature, constructing an uploaded file
          processing status view for an application’s email inbox, and syncing
          it up with matching back-office file processing controls. E.g., For a
          commercial real estate deal, the user could upload a set of building
          layout files to add to the deal’s page, and view the status of this
          file’s acceptance, rejection, modification, etc. by the application’s
          back office data team.
