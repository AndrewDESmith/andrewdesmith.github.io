        About Me
      </h1>
      <div class="grid grid-cols-1 justify-items-center">

          <p class="text-lg mb-2 font-gelasio text-ink-500">
            I’ve been working in full-stack development professionally since
            2016, my main tools being Ruby on Rails and the ecosystem of skills
            and technologies that surround that. I lean more towards the backend
            in my experience, but have done front end and full-stack projects
            using React, vanilla JavaScript, and the old workhouse that was
            jQuery. Similarly, I’m competent in several forms of CSS, including
            libraries such as Bootstrap and Tailwind.

            My developer career began with an internship at a travel startup,
            where I primarily did front end work, but was also exposed to some
            Python and Django. Following that, I had two back-end focused
            contract positions using Ruby and Rails, working on a real estate
            application and a stock exchange app respectively. My first
            permanent developer position was within a small division of a
            private mid-sized recruitment firm, where I worked with the lead
            developer and eventually wore many hats, eventually assuming primary
            responsibility for this firm’s small and medium business self-serve
            recruitment software. After two and a half years there, I moved on
            with a desire to assume more responsibility and learn newer
            technologies, working in more senior full-stack positions on an
            email and LinkedIn sales campaign application, and most recently on
            software for brokers working in commercial real estate transactions.

            I’ve worked in both feature creation and maintenance, and have seen
            setups ranging from the newest and hottest to 10+ year old beasts
            running dead libraries and frameworks, such as
            <a

              class="text-ink-400 hover:text-ink-300"
              >“Hobo”</a
            >. I’m a generalist who favours making code as consistent and
            comprehensible as possible.
