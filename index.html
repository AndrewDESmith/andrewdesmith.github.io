            members in commercial real estate firms need to share and organize
            files within a web application that helps them schedule and
            structure a real estate deal's progression in a consistent way. To
            do so, they submitted files to a back-office data team, which
            verified data integrity. However, they were unable to see the status
            of submitted file processing or consistent reasons behind various
            file submission rejections.

            <span class="font-gelasioBold">Problem:&nbsp;</span> A web
            application focused on assisting salespeople clients in running
            email-based and LinkedIn message-based sales campaigns. Clients
            could manually rate a prospect's overall "sentiment" based on their
            responses to a given series of pre-programmed emails or messages,
            but this was somewhat time consuming and potentially tedious.
            <br />
            <br />
            <span class="font-gelasioBold">Solution:&nbsp;</span> Two separate
            solutions for automated sentiment analysis of customer text
            responses were explored. The first approach used a pre-existing
            commercial API for sentiment analysis, which could be fed a given
            text and returned a sentiment. When this fell through due to a lack
            of communication from the commercial API provider, a second approach
            was explored. This latter approach used an open source latent
            semantic analysis (LSA) natural language processing technique, which
            was fed thousands of previous real customer responses and their
            manually assigned sentiments to train the program for automated
            sentiment assignment of future customer messages.

            <span class="font-gelasioBold">Problem:&nbsp;</span> The same
            software as the "Sentiment Analysis" project made use of huge
            interactor objects, that is, one or more sequential actions modeled
            in code (e.g., generate an email, send it out) that could have
            dozens or hundreds of inputs. The quantity of this data made it
            infeasible to log in a storable format, in its raw form. This meant
            that the engineering team could not search production logs for
            errors.
            <br />
            <br />
            <span class="font-gelasioBold">Solution:&nbsp;</span> A custom
            logging interface to provide an easy to use logging API for
            developers. It allowed for data inputs of interest (e.g., a user's
            ID) to be filtered and logged alongside all accompanying interactor
            events involved with the data. The end result was searchable error
            logs for what were previously opaque bugs found buried in a chain of
            past events.
